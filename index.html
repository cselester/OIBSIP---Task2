    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      As an aspiring engineer, I have been actively exploring various domains of the tech industry. I have developed intermediate-level skills in web development, where I enjoy creating visually appealing and user-friendly websites. I'm proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I constantly strive to enhance my abilities by staying up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies in the field.
      
      In addition to web development, I have also delved into software development, where I have gained practical experience in building applications that cater to specific user needs. I am comfortable working with languages like Python and have a solid understanding of software development principles and best practices.
      
      Furthermore, my curiosity extends to the realm of data science and machine learning. I possess a basic understanding of these concepts and have utilized Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn to analyze data, build predictive models, and extract valuable insights. I am eager to further expand my knowledge and skills in this exciting field.
      
      Apart from my technical skills, I have a firm grasp of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), which enables me to design efficient and optimized solutions to complex problems. Python serves as my go-to programming language for implementing these algorithms and solving coding challenges.
      
      In all my endeavors, I approach tasks with a strong attention to detail, a passion for learning, and a dedication to delivering high-quality results. I thrive in collaborative environments, enjoying the opportunity to work with diverse teams and learn from their expertise.
      
      As I continue my academic journey, I am eager to take on new challenges, expand my skill set, and contribute to innovative projects that make a positive impact. I believe that with the right blend of technical knowledge, creativity, and a growth mindset, I can make a valuable contribution to the world of engineering.
      
      Thank you for taking the time to get to know me better. I look forward to connecting with fellow enthusiasts, professionals, and potential collaborators. If you have any questions or would like to discuss potential opportunities, please feel free to reach out.

    <h2>My Projects</h2>
    <div class="project">
      <h3>Box Office Data Prediction</h3>
      <p>During my IBM Externship, I undertook a project focused on predicting box office data using Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn. With my intermediate level web development and software development skills, I built a predictive model that leveraged data science and machine learning techniques. Alongside my knowledge of data structures and algorithms, I utilized Python programming to analyze and process the box office dataset. This project allowed me to enhance my understanding of data science concepts and apply them to real-world scenarios, demonstrating my proficiency in Python, data manipulation with pandas, data visualization with matplotlib, and machine learning with scikit-learn.</p>

    <div class="project">
      <h3>Study Center Management</h3>
      <p>For my college project, I developed a study center management website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL. This comprehensive website aimed to streamline the management of a study center by providing features such as student enrollment, course management, attendance tracking, and exam scheduling. Through HTML and CSS, I created an intuitive and visually appealing user interface. JavaScript was used to add interactivity and enhance user experience. PHP and MySQL were employed for server-side scripting and database management, respectively. This project showcased my proficiency in front-end and back-end web development, database integration, and problem-solving skills.</p>
